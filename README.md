# Outreach Dashboard

This repository serves as a placeholder for my work undertaken with a market and outreach company to develop a dashboard for client-facing use. During the project, I acted as the lead developer and co-project owner. The dashboard was developed from the ground up with the backend implemented using the Django framework. The front-end  was developed using HTML,CSS, Javascript and several Javascript libraries. Deployment tools used include Gunicorn and Nginx. 

Functionalty of the dashboard include (but where not limited to):
- Tracking of statstics related to outreach campaigns
- Automated alerts relating to campaign events
- Basic CRM funtionality related to campaign contacts
